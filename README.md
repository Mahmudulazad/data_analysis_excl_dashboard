# 🦟 Dengue Dashboard – Dhaka Region
## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive Excel Dashboard designed to analyze dengue patient data from the Dhaka region.
It highlights key health insights such as patient demographics, area-wise dengue cases, diagnostic markers, and high-risk groups.
## 🎯 Objectives
-	Monitor total patients and dengue positive cases
-	Identify high-risk age groups and gender distribution
-	Compare dengue cases across developed vs. undeveloped areas
-	Highlight top 10 high-case areas for targeted interventions
-	Support public health decisions through data visualization




##  Dataset
- Data Source: Sample dataset for project/demo purposes
- File Format: Excel (.xlsx)
- Fields: Gender, Age Group, Area Type, House Type, Diagnostic Markers, Patient Counts

#  Tools & Skills Used
-	Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)
-	Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Dashboard Design & Visualization
- Public Health Data Analysis

# 🔍 Project Insights
- Patient Overview: Out of 1000 patients, 533 were dengue positive.
- Gender Distribution: Female patients (281) slightly outnumber male patients (252).
- Age Risk: Middle-aged individuals (38–47 years) represent the highest dengue risk group (47%), followed by older adults (31%).
- Area Analysis:
o	Undeveloped areas report consistently higher dengue cases compared to developed areas.
o	Housing type matters: tin-shed and poorly built houses show higher dengue incidence.
•	Top High-Risk Areas: Jatrabari, Demra, and Bangshal report the highest number of dengue cases.
•	Diagnostic Markers: IgG and NS1 markers are most frequently detected, showing variations in diagnostic testing.

# ✅ Conclusion
Overall, the dashboard demonstrates how Excel can be used for effective public health data analysis, enabling decision-makers to identify risk factors and focus prevention strategies.
